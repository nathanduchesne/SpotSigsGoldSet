Does milk lower blood pressure? Does juice prevent heart disease?
Beverage studies were four to eight times more likely to reach sweet
conclusions about health effects when industry was footing the bill, a
new report contends. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"We
found evidence that&#8216;s strongly suggestive of bias," said Dr. David
Ludwig, an obesity specialist at Children&#8216;s Hospital Boston who led the
work, which was published Monday in the online science journal PLoS
Medicine. The consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public
Interest also participated. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"I
don&#8216;t blame researchers for this problem. I think most are highly
ethical and dedicated to science. The problem is that when government
underfunds nutrition research, industry money becomes hard to resist,"
he said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"This is yet
another attack on industry by activists who demonstrate their own
biases in their review by looking only at the funding source and not
judging the research on its merits," says a statement by Susan Neely,
president of the American Beverage Association. "The science is what
matters &#8212; nothing else." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"Everybody brings a point of view to the table, and in the long run, that&#8216;s probably a good thing," Miller said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">They
used Medline, a compendium of scientific literature, to identify 538
studies about soda, milk or juice involving people, not animals. They
targeted 206 that made a health claim directly related to the drink
being studied &#8212; for example, bone fractures related to calcium and milk
intake, or immune system benefits from antioxidants in juice. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">One
group of reviewers analyzed study conclusions and classified them as
favorable, neutral or unfavorable to the beverage in question. Another
independent group of reviewers determined whether a study would help,
harm or have no effect on the finances of the study sponsor. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Overall, studies funded entirely by industry were four to eight times more likely to be favorable to their sponsors. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">The
authors&#8216; work was paid for by a grant from the Charles H. Hood
Foundation, which finances research on children&#8216;s issues at Ludwig&#8216;s
hospital. Co-author Dr. Lenard Lesser also had funding from a
fellowship at the Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> ___ </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> On the Net: </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Medical journal: http://www.plosmedicine.org   	 		 <br><br>
