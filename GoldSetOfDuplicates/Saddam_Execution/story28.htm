<span id="articleCopy">

			<p>BAGHDAD (AP) - Saddam Hussein will be
executed no later than Saturday, said an Iraqi judge authorized to
attend his hanging. The former dictator's lawyers said he had been
transferred from U.S. custody, but an Iraqi official said he was still
in the hands of American guards.</p>
			
			<p>The physical transfer
of Saddam to Iraqi authorities was believed to be one of the last steps
before he was to be hanged, although the lawyers' statement did not
specifically say Saddam was in Iraqi hands.</p>
			
			<p>"A few
minutes ago we received correspondence from the Americans saying that
President Saddam Hussein is no longer under the control of U.S.
forces," according to the statement faxed to The Associated Press.</p>
			
			<p>The
statement said U.S. officials asked the lawyers to cancel a trip to
Baghdad for a last meeting with Saddam, saying he was no longer in
American custody.</p>
			
			<p>Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld Saddam's death sentence, said he was ready to attend the execution.</p>
			
			<p>"All the measures have been done," Haddad said. "There is no reason for delays."</p>
			
			<p>In
Baghdad, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has signed Saddam's death
sentence, a government official said. The official, who refused to be
identified by name because he was not authorized to release the
information, said that Iraqi authorities were not yet in control of
Saddam. The discrepancy could not be explained.</p>
			
			<p>"We
have agreed with the Americans that the handover will take place only a
few minutes before he is executed," the official said.</p>
			
			<p>The defence team statement called on "everybody to do everything to stop this unfair execution."</p>
			
			<p>Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki said opposing Saddam's execution was an insult
to his victims. His office said he made the remarks in a meeting with
families of people who died during Saddam's rule.</p>
			
			<p>"Our
respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be
no review or delay in carrying out the sentence," al-Maliki said.</p>
			
			<p>Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. forces were on high alert.</p>
			
			<p>"They'll
obviously take into account social dimensions that could potentially
led to an increase in violence which certainly would include carrying
out the sentence of Saddam Hussein," Whitman said.</p>
			
			<p>On
Thursday, two half brothers visited Saddam in his cell, a member of the
former dictator's defence team, Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated
Press by telephone from the United Arab Emirates. He said the former
dictator handed them his personal belongings.</p>
			
			<p>A senior
commander at the Iraqi defence ministry also confirmed the meeting and
said Saddam gave his will to one of his half brothers. The official
spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak
to the media.</p>
			
			<p>Saddam's lawyers later issued a statement
saying the Americans gave permission for his belongings to be
retrieved. However, Raed Juhi, spokesman for the High Tribunal court
that convicted Saddam, denied that the former leader's relatives
visited him.</p>
			
			<p>An Iraqi appeals court upheld Saddam's
death sentence Tuesday for the killing of 148 people who were detained
after an attempt to assassinate him in the northern Iraqi city of
Dujail in 1982. The court said the former president should be hanged
within 30 days.</p>
			
			<p>There have been disagreements among
Iraqi officials in recent days as to whether Iraqi law dictates the
execution must take place within 30 days and whether President Jalal
Talabani and his two deputies have to approve it.</p>
			
			<p>In his Friday sermon, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf called Saddam's execution "God's gift to Iraqis."</p>
			
			<p>"Oh,
God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in
prisons, in wars with neighbouring countries and he is responsible for
mass graves. Oh God, we ask you to take revenge on Saddam," said Sheik
Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq, known as SCIRI, the dominant party in al-Maliki's
coalition.</p>
			
			<p>With at least 72 more Iraqis killed Thursday
in violence, U.S. officials and Iraqis expressed concern about the
potential for even worse bloodshed following Saddam's execution.</p>
