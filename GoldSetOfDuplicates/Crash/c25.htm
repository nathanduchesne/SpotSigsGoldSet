					<p><span class="headline">Pilots in Ky. Crash Violated Rules</span></p>
			  	    <p><span class="subhead"></span></p>
					<p><span class="byline">By JEFFREY McMURRAY<br>Wednesday, January 17, 2007</span></p>
					<p><span class="story">WASHINGTON
- In the minutes before the crash of a commuter jet that took off from
the wrong runway, the pilots discussed their families, their dogs and
other job opportunities, and the airline said Wednesday that part of
the conversation violated a federal rule against extraneous cockpit
chatter.<br><br>The National Transportation Safety Board released a
transcript Wednesday of the cockpit recording aboard Comair Flight
5191. The recording also showed that one of the pilots noted something
was amiss when he looked down the Lexington, Ky., airstrip and said it
looked "weird" because it had no lights.<br><br>The transcript was the
first public disclosure of the pilots' conversations during the
ill-fated flight, which killed 49 people in the deadliest American
aviation disaster in five years.<br><br>The transcript revealed that
the flight crew "did not follow Comair's general cockpit procedures,"
Comair spokeswoman Kate Marx said. "It is unclear what role, if any,
this played in the accident, so it would be premature to determine
that."<br><br>In 1981, the Federal Aviation Administration adopted a
so-called "sterile cockpit rule" that forbids, among other things,
extraneous conversation during taxi, takeoff and landing.<br><br>As the
pilots went through preflight procedures, Capt. Jeffrey Clay talked
about his young children having colds, and co-pilot James Polehinke
discussed his four dogs. The two men also talked about pay and working
conditions, even as the controller occasionally interrupted to provide
instructions.<br><br>"How old are they?" Polehinke asked six minutes before the crash.<br><br>"Three months and two years old," Clay answered.<br><br>"That's a nice range, age range," Polehinke said.<br><br>Marx
said Comair does not believe those statements violated the rule because
they were made prior to taxi. But a later conversation about a fellow
pilot was a violation, she said.<br><br>FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown
said the sterile cockpit policy prohibits "engaging in non-essential
conversations within the cockpit."<br><br>Peter Goelz, former managing
director at NTSB, said a little extraneous conversation among pilots is
not unusual, but the extent of the chatter between the Comair crew was
rare.<br><br>"I think that when the human factors experts at the NTSB
analyze the transcripts, they will identify this extraneous
conversation as a contributing factor," Goelz said.<br><br>The plane
took off Aug. 27 in the dark from a runway that was too short for a
passenger jet. The plane struggled to get into the air and went down in
flames.<br><br>Polehinke was the lone survivor, losing a leg and
suffering brain damage. He has told relatives he remembers nothing
about that morning.<br><br>According to federal investigators, Clay
taxied the plane onto the wrong runway at Lexington's Blue Grass
Airport before Polehinke took over the controls for takeoff.<br><br>Polehinke said: "I'll take us to Atlanta." Clay responded, "Sure."<br><br>Polehinke
said the runway looked "weird with no lights," according to the
transcript. The captain responded, "Yeah." The last intelligible word
on the recording is the captain saying "Whoa" just a second before
impact.<br><br>An engineering report also released Wednesday concluded
the pilots never tried to abort the takeoff or realized they were on
the wrong runway.<br><br>Sixteen of the passengers suffered smoke
inhalation, indicating they survived the initial impact, the NTSB said.
Other passengers sustained internal and brain injuries, broken bones,
severed limbs and burns.<br><br>In a statement, Comair said: "We
recognize the investigation is a long and difficult process for the
families, especially when announcements _ such as today's _ receive
intense public scrutiny. Our desire is to learn as much as we can in
order to prevent these kinds of accidents from happening again."<br><br>Numerous
lawsuits have been filed accusing Comair of negligence. However, the
airline has sued the airport and the Federal Aviation Administration,
contending they are partially responsible.<br><br>A week before the
crash, the taxiways at Blue Grass were altered as part of a
construction project, but the maps and charts used in the cockpits of
Comair and other airlines were not updated. The FAA did notify airlines
of the changes through a separate announcement.<br><br>The transcripts
and other documents were also the first time federal officials
identified Christopher Damron as the lone air traffic controller on
duty in the tower at the time of the crash.<br><br>The jet was supposed
to take off from the 7,000-foot main runway, called runway 22, but
instead used 3,500-foot runway 26, which is meant only for smaller
planes.<br><br>The NTSB has said Damron cleared the jet for takeoff,
then turned away to do administrative work and did not see the plane
turn down the wrong runway.<br><br>According to documents released
Wednesday, Damron initially told investigators he watched the plane
move onto runway 22. Later he changed his account to explain he just
saw it on the taxiway leading to runway 22.<br><br>After finishing his administrative work, Damron "heard a crash and saw a fireball west of the airport," the NTSB said.<br><br>Damron
was initially placed on leave after the crash but returned to work late
last year. A call to his Lexington home went unanswered Wednesday.<br><br>As
they prepared for takeoff, Polehinke asked, "What runway?" and inquired
about runway 24 _ which does not exist. Clay immediately responded,
"It's 22."<br><br>Louise Roselle, one of the attorneys representing
victims' families, said the pilots' conversation about searching for
other jobs reinforces one of the central issues in the lawsuits related
to the crash.<br><br>"It reinforces how Comair has been treating its pilots," Roselle said.<br><br>Associated Press writer Brett Barrouquere in Louisville, Ky., contributed to this report.<br><br>A service of the Associated Press(AP)</span></p>
