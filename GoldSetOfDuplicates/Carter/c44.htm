<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By DAVID WEBER, Associated Press Writer

</font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> WALTHAM,
Mass. - Jimmy Carter, whose new book has been attacked as slanted
against Israel, received two standing ovations Tuesday as he answered
critics during a much-anticipated talk at a historically Jewish
college.
</font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner acknowledged to an
audience at Brandeis University that "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid"
has "caused great concern in the Jewish community," but noted that it
has nonetheless prompted discussion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
uproar of several months recently prompted 14 members of an advisory
board at Carter's international-affairs think tank, the Carter Center,
to resign in protest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
terms of his appearance had caused a controversy after he declined to
debate Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, a critic of the book.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carter
briefly addressed students and faculty members and responded to 15
questions selected in advance. He responded to criticism and discussed
his efforts during his presidency for peace in the Middle East.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"With
my use of 'apartheid,' I realize this has caused great concern in the
Jewish community. The title makes it clear," Carter said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I can
certainly see now it would provoke some harsh feelings. I chose that
title knowing that it would be provocative, but in the long run it has
precipitated discussion and there has been a lot of positive
discussion."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He said
the book is about conditions in Palestinian territory, not Israel, and
urged Brandeis to send a delegation to the occupied areas to see for
themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It would have a great impact on this nation, on members of Congress and on the nation of Israel," he said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In his
speech, Carter said: "Israel will never find peace until it is willing
to withdraw from the terrorities, and permit the Palestinians to
exercise their basic human rights. The current policy is leading to an
immoral outcome that is undermining Israel's standing in the world."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carter received standing ovations at the beginning and end of his remarks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dershowitz
had hoped to debate Carter but was told he would not be allowed inside.
He was invited to speak in the same hall after Carter, and told the
audience he and Carter are both "pro-Israel and pro-Palestine."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Had he
written a book that was similar to what he said from this stage, I do
not believe there would have been much controversy," he said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dershowitz
said that he also favors an end to Israeli occupation and settlements
in the territories, but that Carter does not talk about the
opportunities Palestinians have passed up to have their own state,
rejecting previous peace deals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"President
Carter makes it sound so simple," he said. "I'm afraid those
simplifications are not really conducive to an enduring peace."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Metal
barricades were erected along the road leading to the athletic center,
where Carter spoke, and people entering the place had to go through a
metal detector.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">About
60 peaceful demonstrators gathered. Many carried signs with a
pro-Palestinian view. Among them: "Closing our eyes to injustice is not
a Jewish value" and "Support Jimmy Carter. End the occupation now."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A
smaller number of demonstrators passed out leaflets pointing out five
portions of Carter's book that they say contained falsehoods.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Brandeis,
in the Boston suburb of Waltham, is a secular university founded by
American Jewish leaders, and about half of its 5,300 students are
Jewish. The school is named after Louis Brandeis, the first Jew on the
Supreme Court and a robust defender of the right to free speech.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carter's
book has been criticized by some Jewish leaders as riddled with
inaccuracies and distortions. Some have complained that it appears to
equate South Africa's former apartheid system of racial segregation
with Israeli treatment of the Palestinians.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carter brokered the 1978 Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt and won the Peace Prize in 2002.
