<h2>Brutal regime ended in a hole</h2>

<p>DAYS after he grabbed power, Saddam Hussein summoned 400 top Iraqi
officials and announced that he had uncovered a plot against the ruling
party. The conspirators, he said, were in that very room. </p>
<p>As the 42-year-old coolly puffed on a cigar, the plotters' names
were read out. As each was called, secret police led them away,
executing 22. To make sure his countrymen got the message, Saddam
videotaped it all and sent copies around the country. </p>
<div id="inline250" style="margin: 3px 0pt 0pt 8px; display: inline; float: right; vertical-align: bottom;"><script type="text/javascript" src="p2_files/init_250x250.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="p2_files/news_002.js"></script><script language="JavaScript" src="p2_files/optn1_002.js"></script><a href="http://servedby.advertising.com/click/site=0000721552/mnum=0000407170" target="_new"><img src="p2_files/Refresh_300x250_v2_32clr.gif" onmouseover="window.open('http://servedby.advertising.com/click/site=0000721552/mnum=0000407170','z','width=600,height=600,toolbar=1,location=1,address=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,location=(100,100)')" border="0" height="250" width="300"></a></div><p>The
plot was a lie. But in a few terrifying minutes on 22 July, 1979,
Saddam eliminated potential rivals, consolidating the power he wielded
for almost a quarter of a century as Iraq's president, until an
American-led coalition drove him out in 2003. </p>
<p>The brutality helped him survive war with Iran, defeat in Kuwait,
rebellions by northern Kurds and southern Shiites, international
sanctions, plots and conspiracies. </p>
<p>In the end, however, it was his undoing. Trusting few except his
kin, Saddam surrounded himself with sycophants, selected for loyalty
rather than intellect and ability. </p>
<p>On his rare public appearances, crowds would greet him with chants
of: "We sacrifice our blood and souls for you, Saddam." But, gradually,
he became isolated from his people, within a diminished circle of
trusted advisers drawn mostly from close family. </p>
<p>The coalition force struck on 20 March, 2003. Within three weeks,
Iraq's army had collapsed and Baghdad had fallen. Saddam fled into
hiding, and his sons, Odai and Qusai, died in a gun battle in Mosul in
July. </p>
<p>When he was forced out, Saddam left a country impoverished - despite
its vast oil wealth - and beset by long suppressed ethnic and sectarian
tensions. </p>
<p>Bearded, dishevelled and with his arms in the air, he was dragged from a hole by American soldiers in December 2001. </p>
<p>When he was captured, Iraqis cheered and fired shots in the air.
"The former dictator of Iraq will face the justice he denied to
millions," said the US president, George Bush. </p>
<p>But as he went on trial in October 2005 before an Iraqi judge,
Saddam's country was already engulfed by an insurgency - a fight that
has since spread. </p>
<p>For Saddam, the trial was a pulpit to rail against the coalition
presence. In the early sessions, he strutted into court, barking at one
point: "How can a judge like yourself accept a situation like this?
This game must not continue. If you want Saddam Hussein's neck, you can
have it." </p>
<p>But as the trial dragged on, his manner seemed to calm as he realised the inevitability of conviction and the death sentence.</p>

		<dd><p>We
must never forget that Saddam was installed by the US in July 1979. He
was aided in an 8 year war against Iran. He was supplied by chemical by
US and EU to use o Iranian troops. He was left to reign after the 1991
Gulf War. And he was not removed for another 12 years. When Americans
got a bit jittery after 9/11, they removed him by launching an illegal
invasion. Now, President Bush is trying to look all innocent and claim
the credit that he removed an evil dictator from Iraq. Iraqis know full
well the real version of events.</p> <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=196&amp;id=1640752006&amp;bad=150305#comment150305" class="report">Report as unsuitable</a> </dd>

		<dd><p>#1 Scott, #8 Mandelson</p><p>Doesn't
really matter whether the US propped him up in power does it? It was
Saddam who used chemical weapons against the Kurds, Saddam who
decimated and destroyed the Marsh Arab's homes and environment. Saddam
and his sons who ran a regime of torture and brutality and denied his
own people fundamental human rights.</p><p>The argument that the wrong
person is in the dock and that it should be the US is just rubbish.
They may have known about it, even been complicit in it at the start,
but, pardon me for pointing out, it was predominantly the US who
toppled him, the US who've supported his trial in an iraqi court.</p><p>In
any principle of law, the person who commits the crime is the one who's
guilty. He may have had accomplices, in the shape of western powers
trying to keep the lid on the middle east, but they weren't the ones
who pulled the trigger.</p><p>If you want to hold the west responsible,
hold them responsible for providing the tools of mass murder - that's
still criminal, but don't conflate Saddam's guilt with the west's tacit
support for him.</p> <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=196&amp;id=1640752006&amp;bad=150400#comment150400" class="report">Report as unsuitable</a> </dd>
