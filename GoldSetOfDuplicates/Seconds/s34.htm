			<h1>Pilots on wrong runway in Kentucky crash noted 'weird' lack of runway lights</h1>
			<h3>Canadian Press</h3>
			<div id="story_main"><p>
WASHINGTON (AP) - In the minutes before the crash of a commuter jet
that took off from the wrong runway in Lexington, Ky., the pilots
discussed their families and job opportunities, violating a rule
against extraneous cockpit conversation, the airline said Wednesday.
</p><p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board released a
transcript Wednesday of the cockpit recording aboard Comair Flight
5191. It was the first public disclosure of the pilots' conversations
during the ill-fated flight, which was the deadliest U.S. aviation
disaster in five years.
</p><p>
The transcript revealed the flight crew "did not follow Comair's general cockpit procedures," Comair spokeswoman Kate Marx said.

</p><p>
"It is unclear what role, if any, this played in the accident, so it would be premature to determine that."

</p><p>In 1981, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approved a
so-called "sterile cockpit rule" that forbids, among other things,
extraneous conversation during taxi, takeoff and landing.
</p><p>As the pilots went through preflight procedures, Capt. Jeffrey
Clay talked about his young children having colds and co-pilot James
Polehinke discussed his four dogs. The two men also discussed pay and
working conditions, even as the controller occasionally interrupted to
provide instructions.
</p><p>
"How old are they?" Polehinke asked six minutes before the crash.

</p><p>
"Three months and two years old," Clay answered.

</p><p>
"That's a nice range, age range," Polehinke said.

</p><p>Forty-nine of the 50 people aboard the flight died Aug. 27 after
the plane took off in the dark from a runway too short for a passenger
jet. The plane struggled to get into the air and went down in flames.
</p><p>Polehinke was the lone survivor, losing a leg and suffering
brain damage. He has told relatives he remembers nothing about that
morning.
</p><p>Federal investigators said Clay taxied the plane onto the wrong
runway at Lexington's Blue Grass Airport before Polehinke took over the
controls for takeoff.
</p><p>
Polehinke said: "I'll take us to Atlanta."

</p><p>
Clay responded: "Sure."

</p><p>
Polehinke said the runway looked "weird with no lights," the transcript showed.

</p><p>
The captain responded: "Yeah."

</p><p>
The last intelligible word on the recording is the captain saying: "Whoa" just a second before impact.

</p><p>An engineering report also released Wednesday concluded the
pilots never tried to abort the takeoff or realized they were on the
wrong runway.
</p><p>Sixteen of the passengers suffered smoke-inhalation, indicating
they survived the initial impact, the NTSB said. Other passengers
sustained internal and brain injuries, broken bones, severed limbs and
burns.
</p><p>In a statement, Comair said: "We recognize the investigation is
a long and difficult process for the families, especially when
announcements - such as today's - receive intense public scrutiny. Our
desire is to learn as much as we can in order to prevent these kinds of
accidents from happening again."
</p><p>Numerous lawsuits have been filed accusing Comair of
negligence. However, the airline has sued the airport and the Federal
Aviation Administration, contending they are partially responsible.
</p><p>A week before the crash, the taxiways at Blue Grass were
altered as part of a construction project but the maps and charts used
in the cockpits of Comair and other airlines were not updated. The FAA
did notify airlines of the changes through a separate announcement.
</p><p>The transcripts and other documents were also the first time
federal officials identified Christopher Damron as the lone air traffic
controller on duty in the tower at the time of the crash.
</p><p>The jet was supposed to take off from the 2,133-metre main
runway, called runway 22, but instead used 1,066-metre runway 26, which
is meant only for smaller planes.
</p><p>The NTSB has said Damron cleared the jet for takeoff, then
turned away to do administrative work and did not see the plane turn
down the wrong runway.
</p><p>Documents released Wednesday showed Damron initially told
investigators he watched the plane move onto runway 22. Later he
changed his account to explain he just saw it on the taxiway leading to
runway 22.
</p><p>
After finishing his administrative work, Damron "heard a crash and saw a fireball west of the airport," the NTSB said.

</p><p>Damron was initially placed on leave after the crash but
returned to work late last year. A call to his Lexington home went
unanswered Wednesday.
</p><p>
As they prepared for takeoff, Polehinke asked: "What runway?" and inquired about runway 24 - which does not exist.

</p><p>
Clay immediately responded: "It's 22."

</p><p>Louise Roselle, one of the lawyers representing victims'
families, said the pilots' conversation about searching for other jobs
reinforces one of the central issues in the lawsuits related to the
crash.
</p><p>
"It reinforces how Comair has been treating its pilots," Roselle said.
