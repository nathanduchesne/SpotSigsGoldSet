This repository contains the GoldSet created for this paper, which remained the reference benchmark ever since its creation for near-duplicate detection. It was given to me by Prof. Theobald in 2024 after it no longer was available online. 

The dataset was previously hosted on Prof. Theobald's Max Planck Institut page (https://mpi-inf.mpg.de/~mtb) before being moved to his University of Antwerp web page (https://adrem.ua.ac.be/~tmartin).
