					<p><span class="headline">Judge: Saddam to Be Executed by Saturday</span></p>
			  	    <p><span class="subhead"></span></p>
					<p><span class="byline">By LAUREN FRAYER<br>Friday, December 29, 2006</span></p>
					<p><span class="story">BAGHDAD,
Iraq - Saddam Hussein will be executed no later than Saturday, said an
Iraqi judge authorized to attend his hanging. The former dictator's
lawyers said he had been transferred from U.S. custody, but an Iraqi
official said he was still in the hands of American guards.<br><br>The
physical transfer of Saddam to Iraqi authorities was believed to be one
of the last steps before he was to be hanged, although the lawyers'
statement did not specifically say Saddam was in Iraqi hands.<br><br>"A
few minutes ago we received correspondence from the Americans saying
that President Saddam Hussein is no longer under the control of U.S.
forces," according to the statement faxed to The Associated Press.<br><br>The
statement said U.S. officials asked the lawyers to cancel a trip to
Baghdad for a last meeting with Saddam, saying he was no longer in
American custody.<br><br>Munir Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld Saddam's death sentence, said he was ready to attend the execution.<br><br>"All the measures have been done," Haddad said. "There is no reason for delays."<br><br>In
Baghdad, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has signed Saddam's death
sentence, a government official said. The official, who refused to be
identified by name because he was not authorized to release the
information, said that Iraqi authorities were not yet in control of
Saddam. The discrepancy could not be explained.<br><br>"We have agreed
with the Americans that the handover will take place only a few minutes
before he is executed," the official said.<br><br>The defense team statement called on "everybody to do everything to stop this unfair execution."<br><br>Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki said opposing Saddam's execution was an insult
to his victims. His office said he made the remarks in a meeting with
families of people who died during Saddam's rule.<br><br>"Our respect
for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be no
review or delay in carrying out the sentence," al-Maliki said.<br><br>Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. forces were on high alert.<br><br>"They'll
obviously take into account social dimensions that could potentially
led to an increase in violence which certainly would include carrying
out the sentence of Saddam Hussein," Whitman said.<br><br>On Thursday,
two half brothers visited Saddam in his cell, a member of the former
dictator's defense team, Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated Press by
telephone from the United Arab Emirates. He said the former dictator
handed them his personal belongings.<br><br>A senior commander at the
Iraqi defense ministry also confirmed the meeting and said Saddam gave
his will to one of his half brothers. The official spoke on condition
of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.<br><br>Saddam's
lawyers later issued a statement saying the Americans gave permission
for his belongings to be retrieved. However, Raed Juhi, spokesman for
the High Tribunal court that convicted Saddam, denied that the former
leader's relatives visited him.<br><br>An Iraqi appeals court upheld
Saddam's death sentence Tuesday for the killing of 148 people who were
detained after an attempt to assassinate him in the northern Iraqi city
of Dujail in 1982. The court said the former president should be hanged
within 30 days.<br><br>There have been disagreements among Iraqi
officials in recent days as to whether Iraqi law dictates the execution
must take place within 30 days and whether President Jalal Talabani and
his two deputies have to approve it.<br><br>In his Friday sermon, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf called Saddam's execution "God's gift to Iraqis."<br><br>"Oh,
God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in
prisons, in wars with neighboring countries and he is responsible for
mass graves. Oh God, we ask you to take revenge on Saddam," said Sheik
Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq, known as SCIRI, the dominant party in al-Maliki's
coalition.<br><br>With at least 72 more Iraqis killed Thursday in
violence, U.S. officials and Iraqis expressed concern about the
potential for even worse bloodshed following Saddam's execution.<br><br>In
the latest violence, a suicide bomber killed nine people near a Shiite
mosque north of Baghdad on Friday, police said. A round of mortar
shells also slammed into al-Maidan square in central Baghdad, wounding
ten people and damaging shops and buildings in the area, police said.<br><br>Gunmen
killed two employees of an oil company and another civilian in Mosul,
250 miles northwest of Baghdad. Two civilians and a policeman were
fatally shot in separate attacks in Musayyib, about 40 miles south of
the capital, police said.<br><br>U.S. troops, meanwhile, killed six
people and destroyed a weapons cache in separate raids in Baghdad and
northwest of the Iraqi capital, the U.S. military said.<br><br>One of
the raids targeted two buildings in the village of Thar Thar, where
U.S. troops found 16 pounds of homemade explosives, two large bombs, a
rocket-propelled grenade, suicide vests and multiple batteries, the
military said.<br><br>Iraqi forces backed by U.S. troops also captured
13 suspects and confiscated weapons in a raid on a mosque southeast of
Baghdad, the U.S. military said Friday.<br><br>Associated Press writers Shafika Mattar in Amman, Jordan, and Salah Nasrawi in Cairo, Egypt contributed to this report.<br><br>A service of the Associated Press(AP)</span></p>
