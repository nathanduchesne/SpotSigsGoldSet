			<h1>Prince William's girlfriend turns 25 as media fuels rumours of engagement</h1>
			<h3>Canadian Press</h3>
			<div id="story_main"><p>
LONDON (AP) - She makes headlines for getting a parking ticket,
newspapers comment on her fashion choices and her 25th birthday on
Tuesday is generating a media storm.
</p><p>Prince William's girlfriend, Kate Middleton, may one day become
queen of England. Before that, she is undergoing the ordeal seemingly
demanded of royal wannabes since Lady Diana Spencer began dating Prince
Charles more than 25 years ago.
</p><p>
A frenzy is building around the young woman - fuelled, perhaps, by a large dose of wishful thinking from the 	press and public.

</p><p>Pictures of the brunette fashion buyer, who has dated William
since both were university students, fetch thousands of pounds from the
tabloid press. Paparazzi follow her on her way to work, on shopping
trips and on nights out with the prince. One recent, widely published,
snapshot showed Middleton receiving a ticket from a parking warden
outside her London home.
</p><p>The retail chain Woolworths has commissioned Wills-and-Kate
engagement memorabilia, despite the absence of any evidence that a
betrothal announcement is imminent.
</p><p>"It would be more of a surprise now if they split than if they
marry," said Robert Jobson, author of the recently published book
"William's Princess."
</p><p>"I think it's only a matter of time before this role of
princess in waiting is changed to being a real princess and maybe one
day queen consort."
</p><p>British bookmaking firm William Hill says it is so certain
William will pop the question it has stopped taking bets on whether the
pair will get engaged - only on the date.
</p><p>
"We're certain they will - it's a question of when, not if," said spokesman Rupert Adams.

</p><p>William Hill says it is a 4-5 probability the pair will announce
their engagement in 2007, and is offering 3-1 odds they will marry this
year.
</p><p>The prince and Middleton have dated since they were both
students at St. Andrews University in Scotland, and were first
photographed together on a skiing holiday shortly before their
graduation in 2005.
</p><p>
There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that the two may soon announce their engagement.

</p><p>Born in the commuter town of Reading, west of London, Middleton
- unlike most previous royal consorts - is a quintessentially
middle-class Englishwoman. Her father worked for an airline and her
mother was a flight attendant; they now run a mail-order business
specializing in children's parties.
</p><p>She attended Marlborough College, an elite private school,
where she played tennis and field hockey, before studying art history
at St. Andrews. She and William shared a student house in the seaside
university town.
</p><p>Amid the spiralling media interest, Middleton, and the royal
family, want to avoid a repeat of the paparazzi hounding endured by
William's mother, the late Princess Diana.
</p><p>
Preliminary hearings for an inquest into Diana's death in a 1997 car crash opened at London's Royal Courts of Justice on Monday.

</p><p>Middleton is older, and perhaps better prepared for media
scrutiny, than Diana, who was just 19 when she began dating Prince
Charles. The pair married in 1981, in a fairy-tale ceremony at St.
Paul's Cathedral watched by an estimated 700 million people around the
world on television.
</p><p>
Reality soon set in, and Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after admissions of adultery on both sides.

</p><p>Middleton's lawyers have complained to newspaper editors,
requesting she be left alone, and British newspapers have recently
reported that she is to be given a round-the-clock guard from the
police royal protection squad - a key sign of inclusion in the royal
circle.
</p><p>
Prince William's Clarence House office and the Metropolitan Police both refused to comment on security arrangements.

</p><p>However, the royal family appears to be quietly easing Middleton
into its public events. Last month, she was in attendance, along with
the queen, when William, 24, graduated from Sandhurst military academy.
He has since joined the Blues and Royals, an elite cavalry regiment.
</p><p>"The Queen was there, yet Kate stole the limelight," Jobson
said. "The fact they allowed her to do that signalled intent. It shows
that this is a very serious relationship. It's not a frivolous one."
