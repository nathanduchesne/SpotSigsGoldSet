</font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">
WASHINGTON - In the minutes before the crash of a commuter jet that
took off from the wrong runway, the pilots discussed their families,
their dogs and job opportunities, violating at times a rule against
extraneous cockpit conversation, the airline said Wednesday.
</font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
National Transportation Safety Board released a transcript Wednesday of
the cockpit recording aboard Comair Flight 5191. The transcript also
showed that one of the pilots noted something was amiss when he glanced
down the Lexington, Ky., airstrip and said it looked "weird" because it
had no lights.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
transcript was the first public disclosure of the pilots' conversations
during the ill-fated flight, which struggled to get airborne after
trying to take off from a runway that was too short for passenger jets.
The plane went down in flames, killing 49 people in the deadliest
American aviation disaster in five years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
transcript revealed that the flight crew "did not follow Comair's
general cockpit procedures," Comair spokeswoman Kate Marx said. "It is
unclear what role, if any, this played in the accident, so it would be
premature to determine that."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In
1981, the Federal Aviation Administration adopted a so-called "sterile
cockpit rule" that prohibits, among other things, extraneous
conversation during taxi, takeoff and landing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As the
pilots went through preflight procedures, Capt. Jeffrey Clay talked
about his young children having colds, and co-pilot James Polehinke
discussed his four dogs. The two men also talked about pay and working
conditions, even as the controller occasionally interrupted to provide
instructions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"How old are they?" Polehinke asked six minutes before the crash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Three months and two years old," Clay answered.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"That's a nice range, age range," Polehinke said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Marx
said Comair does not believe those statements violated the rule because
they were made before the aircraft began to taxi. But a later
conversation about a fellow pilot was a violation, she said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">FAA
spokeswoman Laura Brown said the sterile cockpit policy prohibits
"engaging in non-essential conversations within the cockpit."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Peter
Goelz, former managing director at the NTSB, said a little extraneous
conversation among pilots is not unusual, but the extent of the chatter
between the Comair crew was rare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I
think that when the human-factors experts at the NTSB analyze the
transcripts, they will identify this extraneous conversation as a
contributing factor," Goelz said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Polehinke
was the lone survivor of the Aug. 27 crash, losing a leg and suffering
brain damage. He has told relatives he remembers nothing about that
morning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">According
to federal investigators, Clay taxied the plane onto the wrong runway
at Lexington's Blue Grass Airport before Polehinke took over the
controls for takeoff.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Polehinke said: "I'll take us to Atlanta." Clay responded, "Sure."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Polehinke
said the runway looked "weird with no lights," according to the
transcript. The captain responded, "Yeah." The last intelligible word
on the recording is the captain saying "Whoa" just a second before
impact.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An
engineering report also released Wednesday concluded the pilots never
tried to abort the takeoff or realized they were on the wrong runway.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sixteen of
the passengers suffered smoke inhalation, indicating they survived the
initial impact, the NTSB said. Other passengers sustained internal and
brain injuries, broken bones, severed limbs and burns.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In a
statement, Comair said: "We recognize the investigation is a long and
difficult process for the families, especially when announcements &#8212;
such as today's &#8212; receive intense public scrutiny. Our desire is to
learn as much as we can in order to prevent these kinds of accidents
from happening again."
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Numerous
lawsuits have been filed accusing Comair of negligence. However, the
airline has sued the airport and the Federal Aviation Administration,
contending they are partially responsible.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A week
before the crash, the taxiways at Blue Grass were altered as part of a
construction project, but the maps and charts used in the cockpits of
Comair and other airlines were not updated. The FAA did notify airlines
of the changes through a separate announcement.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
transcripts and other documents were also the first time federal
officials identified Christopher Damron as the lone air traffic
controller on duty in the tower at the time of the crash.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The jet
was supposed to take off from the 7,000-foot main runway, called runway
22, but instead used 3,500-foot runway 26, which is meant only for
smaller planes.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The NTSB
has said Damron cleared the jet for takeoff, then turned away to do
administrative work and did not see the plane turn down the wrong
runway.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">According
to documents released Wednesday, Damron initially told investigators he
watched the plane move onto runway 22. Later he changed his account to
explain he just saw it on the taxiway leading to runway 22.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After finishing his administrative work, Damron "heard a crash and saw a fireball west of the airport," the NTSB said.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Damron was
initially placed on leave after the crash but returned to work late
last year. A call to his Lexington home went unanswered Wednesday.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As they
prepared for takeoff, Polehinke asked, "What runway?" and inquired
about runway 24 &#8212; which does not exist. Clay immediately responded,
"It's 22."
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Louise
Roselle, one of the attorneys representing victims' families, said the
autopsy reports could raise questions about the aircraft, a Bombardier
CL-600-2B19 (CRJ-100), if people survived the impact but were unable to
escape.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"This
plane did not get more than about eight feet off the ground," Roselle
said. "All but one person died. You have to ask the question of why did
they die?"
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Marc
Duchesne, a spokesman for Bombardier Aerospace, said in a telephone
interview that "the CRJ family is an extremely safe and reliable
aircraft," with more than 1,000 jets in service.
