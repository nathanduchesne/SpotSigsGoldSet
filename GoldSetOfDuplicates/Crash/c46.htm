WASHINGTON - In the minutes before the crash of a commuter jet that
took off from the wrong runway, the pilots discussed their families,
their dogs and other job opportunities, and the airline said Wednesday
that part of the conversation violated a federal rule against
extraneous cockpit chatter. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">The
National Transportation Safety Board released a transcript Wednesday of
the cockpit recording aboard Comair Flight 5191. The recording also
showed that one of the pilots noted something was amiss when he looked
down the Lexington, Ky., airstrip and said it looked "weird" because it
had no lights. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">The
transcript revealed that the flight crew "did not follow Comair&#8216;s
general cockpit procedures," Comair spokeswoman Kate Marx said. "It is
unclear what role, if any, this played in the accident, so it would be
premature to determine that." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">In
1981, the Federal Aviation Administration adopted a so-called "sterile
cockpit rule" that forbids, among other things, extraneous conversation
during taxi, takeoff and landing. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"How old are they?" Polehinke asked six minutes before the crash. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"That&#8216;s a nice range, age range," Polehinke said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">FAA
spokeswoman Laura Brown said the sterile cockpit policy prohibits
"engaging in non-essential conversations within the cockpit." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"I
think that when the human factors experts at the NTSB analyze the
transcripts, they will identify this extraneous conversation as a
contributing factor," Goelz said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Polehinke
was the lone survivor, losing a leg and suffering brain damage. He has
told relatives he remembers nothing about that morning. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Polehinke said: "I&#8216;ll take us to Atlanta." Clay responded, "Sure." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
An engineering report also released Wednesday concluded the pilots
never tried to abort the takeoff or realized they were on the wrong
runway. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Sixteen of the
passengers suffered smoke inhalation, indicating they survived the
initial impact, the NTSB said. Other passengers sustained internal and
brain injuries, broken bones, severed limbs and burns. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
In a statement, Comair said: "We recognize the investigation is a long
and difficult process for the families, especially when announcements &#8212;
such as today&#8216;s &#8212; receive intense public scrutiny. Our desire is to
learn as much as we can in order to prevent these kinds of accidents
from happening again." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Numerous lawsuits have been filed accusing Comair of negligence.
However, the airline has sued the airport and the Federal Aviation
Administration, contending they are partially responsible. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
A week before the crash, the taxiways at Blue Grass were altered as
part of a construction project, but the maps and charts used in the
cockpits of Comair and other airlines were not updated. The FAA did
notify airlines of the changes through a separate announcement. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
The transcripts and other documents were also the first time federal
officials identified Christopher Damron as the lone air traffic
controller on duty in the tower at the time of the crash. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
The jet was supposed to take off from the 7,000-foot main runway,
called runway 22, but instead used 3,500-foot runway 26, which is meant
only for smaller planes. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
The NTSB has said Damron cleared the jet for takeoff, then turned away
to do administrative work and did not see the plane turn down the wrong
runway. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> According to
documents released Wednesday, Damron initially told investigators he
watched the plane move onto runway 22. Later he changed his account to
explain he just saw it on the taxiway leading to runway 22. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> After finishing his administrative work, Damron "heard a crash and saw a fireball west of the airport," the NTSB said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Damron was initially placed on leave after the crash but returned to
work late last year. A call to his Lexington home went unanswered
Wednesday. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> As they prepared
for takeoff, Polehinke asked, "What runway?" and inquired about runway
24 &#8212; which does not exist. Clay immediately responded, "It&#8216;s 22." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Louise Roselle, one of the attorneys representing victims&#8216; families,
said the pilots&#8216; conversation about searching for other jobs reinforces
one of the central issues in the lawsuits related to the crash. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> "It reinforces how Comair has been treating its pilots," Roselle said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> ___ </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Associated Press writer Brett Barrouquere in Louisville, Ky., contributed to this report.   	 		 <br><br>
