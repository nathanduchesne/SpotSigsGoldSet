            <br>
            By LAUREN FRAYER<br>
            <em>Associated Press writer</em><br>
            <em><br>
            </em>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BAGHDAD, Iraq &#8212; Saddam Hussein will be
executed no later than Saturday, said an Iraqi judge authorized to
attend his hanging. The former dictator's lawyers said he had been
transferred from U.S. custody, but an Iraqi official said he was still
in the hands of American guards.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
physical transfer of Saddam to Iraqi authorities was believed to be one
of the last steps before he was to be hanged, although the lawyers'
statement did not specifically say Saddam was in Iraqi hands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few minutes ago we received
correspondence from the Americans saying that President Saddam Hussein
is no longer under the control of U.S. forces," according to the
statement faxed to The Associated Press. Munir Haddad, a judge on the
appeals court that upheld Saddam's death sentence, said he was ready to
attend the execution.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the measures have been done," Haddad said. "There is no reason for delays."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Baghdad, Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki has signed Saddam's death sentence, a government official
said. The official, who refused to be identified by name because he was
not authorized to release the information, said that Iraqi authorities
were not yet in control of Saddam. The discrepancy could not be
explained.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have agreed with the Americans that
the handover will take place only a few minutes before he is excuted,"
the official said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defense team statement called on
"everybody to do everything to stop this unfair execution."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said
opposing Saddam's execution was an insult to his victims. His office
said he made the remarks in a meeting with families of people who died
during Saddam's rule.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our respect for human rights requires
us to execute him, and there will be no review or delay in carrying out
the sentence," al-Maliki said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said U.S. forces were on high alert.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They'll obviously take into account
social dimensions that could potentially led to an increase in violence
which certainly would include carrying out the sentence of Saddam
Hussein," Whitman said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Thursday, two half brothers visited
Saddam in his cell, a member of the former dictator's defense team,
Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated Press by telephone from the
United Arab Emirates. He said the former dictator handed them his
personal belongings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A senior commander at the Iraqi defense
ministry also confirmed the meeting and said Saddam gave his will to
one of his half brothers. The official spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to speak to the media.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saddam's lawyers later issued a statement
saying the Americans gave permission for his belongings to be
retrieved. However, Raed Juhi, spokesman for the High Tribunal court
that convicted Saddam, denied that the former leader's relatives
visited him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Iraqi appeals court upheld Saddam's
death sentence Tuesday for the killing of 148 people who were detained
after an attempt to assassinate him in the northern Iraqi city of
Dujail in 1982. The court said the former president should be hanged
within 30 days.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been disagreements among Iraqi
officials in recent days as to whether Iraqi law dictates the execution
must take place within 30 days and whether President Jalal Talabani and
his two deputies have to approve it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Friday sermon, a mosque preacher
in the Shiite holy city of Najaf called Saddam's execution "God's gift
to Iraqis."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, God, you know what Saddam has done!
He killed millions of Iraqis in prisons, in wars with neighboring
countries and he is responsible for mass graves. Oh God, we ask you to
take revenge on Saddam," said Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of
the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, known as SCIRI,
the dominant party in al-Maliki's coalition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With at least 72 more Iraqis killed
Thursday in violence, U.S. officials and Iraqis expressed concern about
the potential for even worse bloodshed following Saddam's execution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latest violence, a suicide bomber
killed nine people near a Shiite mosque north of Baghdad on Friday,
police said. A round of mortar shells also slammed into al-Maidan
square in central Baghdad, wounding ten people and damaging shops and
buildings in the area, police said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gunmen killed two employees of an oil
company and another civilian in Mosul, 250 miles northwest of Baghdad.
Two civilians and a policeman were fatally shot in separate attacks in
Musayyib, about 40 miles south of the capital, police said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. troops, meanwhile, killed six people
and destroyed a weapons cache in separate raids in Baghdad and
northwest of the Iraqi capital, the U.S. military said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the raids targeted two buildings
in the village of Thar Thar, where U.S. troops found 16 pounds of
homemade explosives, two large bombs, a rocket-propelled grenade,
suicide vests and multiple batteries, the military said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraqi forces backed by U.S. troops also
captured 13 suspects and confiscated weapons in a raid on a mosque
southeast of Baghdad, the U.S. military said Friday.</p>
