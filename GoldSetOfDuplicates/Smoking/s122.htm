WASHINGTON - Damage to a silver dollar-sized spot deep in the brain
seems to wipe out the urge to smoke, a surprising discovery that may
shed important new light on addiction. The research was inspired by a
stroke survivor who claimed he simply forgot his two-pack-a-day
addiction _ no cravings, no nicotine patches, not even a conscious
desire to quit. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Clearly brain damage isn&#8216;t a treatment option for people struggling to kick the habit. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"It&#8216;s
a fantastic paper, it&#8216;s a fantastic finding," said Dr. Nora Volkow,
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a longtime
investigator of the brain&#8216;s addiction pathways. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Why?
The insula appears to be where the brain turns physical reactions into
feelings, such as feeling anxious when your heart speeds up. When those
reactions are caused by a particular substance, the insula may act like
sort of a headquarters for cravings. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Nicotine
is one of the most addictive substances known, and it&#8216;s common for
smokers to suffer repeated relapses when they try to quit. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">At
the time, Bechara was at the University of Iowa studying the effects of
certain types of brain damage after strokes or other injury. While
Nathan was hospitalized, stroke specialists sent his information to
that brain registry. He was 38, had smoked since 14, said he enjoyed it
and had had no intention to quit. But his last puff was the night
before his stroke. His surprised wife said he never even asked for a
smoke while in the hospital. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Instead, Nathan experienced what Bechara calls a "disruption of smoking addiction," and he wanted to know why. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Of
the remaining 50 patients with damage in other brain regions, 19 quit
smoking but only four met the broken-addiction criteria. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">More
immediately, NIDA&#8216;s Volkow wants to try a different experiment:
Scientists can temporarily alter function of certain brain regions with
pulses of magnetic energy, called "transcranial magnetic stimulation."
She wants to see if it&#8216;s possible to focus such magnetic pulses on the
insula, and thus verify its role. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Other
neurologic functions are known to be involved with addiction, too, such
as the brain&#8216;s "reward" or pleasure pathways. The insula discovery
doesn&#8216;t contradict that work, but adds another layer to how addiction
grips the brain, Bechara said. <br><br>
