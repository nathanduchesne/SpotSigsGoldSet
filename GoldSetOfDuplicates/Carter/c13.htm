   <br><br></font><p><font face="arial" size="2">					 	 		</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> By DAVID WEBER, Associated Press Writer  Tue Jan 23, 10:47 PM ET  		 	  </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
WALTHAM, Mass. - Jimmy Carter, whose new book has been attacked as
slanted against Israel , received two standing ovations Tuesday as he
answered critics during a much-anticipated talk at a historically
Jewish college. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">The uproar
of several months recently prompted 14 members of an advisory board at
Carter&#8216;s international-affairs think tank, the Carter Center, to resign
in protest. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Carter briefly
addressed students and faculty members and responded to 15 questions
selected in advance. He responded to criticism and discussed his
efforts during his presidency for peace in the Middle East. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"I
can certainly see now it would provoke some harsh feelings. I chose
that title knowing that it would be provocative, but in the long run it
has precipitated discussion and there has been a lot of positive
discussion." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"It would have a great impact on this nation, on members of Congress and on the nation of Israel," he said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Carter received standing ovations at the beginning and end of his remarks. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"Had
he written a book that was similar to what he said from this stage, I
do not believe there would have been much controversy," he said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"President
Carter makes it sound so simple," he said. "I&#8216;m afraid those
simplifications are not really conducive to an enduring peace." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">About
60 peaceful demonstrators gathered. Many carried signs with a
pro-Palestinian view. Among them: "Closing our eyes to injustice is not
a Jewish value" and "Support Jimmy Carter. End the occupation now." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Brandeis, in the Boston suburb of Waltham, is a secular university
founded by American Jewish leaders, and about half of its 5,300
students are Jewish. The school is named after Louis Brandeis, the
first Jew on the Supreme Court and a robust defender of the right to
free speech. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Carter&#8216;s book
has been criticized by some Jewish leaders as riddled with inaccuracies
and distortions. Some have complained that it appears to equate South
Africa&#8216;s former apartheid system of racial segregation with Israeli
treatment of the Palestinians. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Carter brokered the 1978 Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt and won the Peace Prize in 2002. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> ___ </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> On the Net: </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Brandeis University: http://www.brandeis.edu   	 		 <br><br>
