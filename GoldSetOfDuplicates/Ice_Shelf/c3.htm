(12/10/06) -- Research on vitamin D has flooded out over the past few
months, linking a growing array of health ills to low levels of the
nutrient. Scientists now know that the vitamin, which is naturally
produced in skin exposed to the sun's ultraviolet rays, binds to cell
receptors throughout the body and that a lack can cause various systems
to malfunction. Last week, for example, University of Pittsburgh
researchers reported that a D deficiency doubles the risk of dangerous
hypertension during pregnancy, since the nutrient helps control a
hormone affecting blood pressure. In March, a study examining how the
vitamin affects the pancreas's release of insulin found the risk of
diabetes to be one-third lower in people with the highest levels than
in those getting the least. "The vitamin D story is becoming clear. I
think it's very exciting," says Robert Heaney, a professor of medicine
at Creighton University in Nebraska who has researched the nutrient's
effects on the bones and who, like many researchers, now thinks
supplements are a good idea.<br clear="all">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Comments made by visitors.<br>&nbsp;<br></td></tr>
