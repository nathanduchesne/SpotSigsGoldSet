CHICAGO - In a case fraught with ethical questions, the parents of a
severely mentally and physically disabled child have stunted her growth
to keep their little "pillow angel" a manageable and more portable
size.
</p><p>The bedridden 9-year-old girl had her uterus and breast tissue
removed at a Seattle hospital and received large doses of hormones to
halt her growth. She is now 4-foot-5; her parents say she would
otherwise probably reach a normal 5-foot-6.
</p><p>The case has captured attention nationwide and abroad via the
Internet, with some decrying the parents' actions as perverse and akin
to eugenics. Some ethicists question the parents' claim that the
drastic treatment will benefit their daughter and allow them to
continue caring for her at home.
</p><p>University of Pennsylvania ethicist Art Caplan said the case is
troubling and reflects "slippery slope" thinking among parents who
believe "the way to deal with my kid with permanent behavioral problems
is to put them into permanent childhood."
</p><p>Right or wrong, the couple's decision highlights a dilemma
thousands of parents face in struggling to care for severely disabled
children as they grow up.
</p><p>"This particular treatment, even if it's OK in this situation,
and I think it probably is, is not a widespread solution and ignores
the large social issues about caring for people with disabilities," Dr.
Joel Frader, a medical ethicist at Chicago's Children's Memorial
Hospital, said Thursday. "As a society, we do a pretty rotten job of
helping caregivers provide what's necessary for these patients."
</p><p>The case involves a girl identified only as Ashley on a blog
her parents created after her doctors wrote about her treatment in
October's Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine. The journal
did not disclose the parents' names or where they live; the couple do
not identify themselves on their blog, either.
</p><p>Shortly after birth, Ashley had feeding problems and showed
severe developmental delays. Her doctors diagnosed static
encephalopathy, which means severe brain damage. They do not know what
caused it.
</p><p>Her condition has left her in an infant state, unable to sit
up, roll over, hold a toy or walk or talk. Her parents say she will
never get better. She is alert, startles easily, and smiles, but does
not maintain eye contact, according to her parents, who call the
brown-haired little girl their "pillow angel."
</p><p>She goes to school for disabled children, but her parents care
for her at home and say they have been unable to find suitable outside
help.
</p><p>An editorial in the medical journal called "the Ashley
treatment" ill-advised and questioned whether it will even work. But
her parents say it has succeeded so far.
</p><p>She had surgery in July 2004 and recently completed the hormone
treatment. She weighs about 65 pounds, and is about 13 inches shorter
and 50 pounds lighter than she would be as an adult, according to her
parents' blog.
</p><p>"Ashley's smaller and lighter size makes it more possible to
include her in the typical family life and activities that provide her
with needed comfort, closeness, security and love: meal time, car
trips, touch, snuggles, etc.," her parents wrote.
</p><p>Also, Ashley's parents say keeping her small will reduce the
risk of bedsores and other conditions that can afflict bedridden
patients. In addition, they say preventing her from going through
puberty means she won't experience the discomfort of periods or grow
breasts that might develop breast cancer, which runs in the family.
</p><p>"Even though caring for Ashley involves hard and continual
work, she is a blessing and not a burden," her parents say. Still, they
write, "Unless you are living the experience ... you have no clue what
it is like to be the bedridden child or their caregivers."
</p><p>Caplan questioned how preventing normal growth could benefit
the patient. Treatment that is not for a patient's direct benefit "only
seems wrong to me," the ethicist said.
</p><p>Dr. Douglas Diekema, an ethicist at Children's Hospital and
Regional Medical Center in Seattle, where Ashley was treated, said he
met with the parents and became convinced they were motivated by love
and the girl's best interests.
</p><p>Diekema said he was mainly concerned with making sure the
little girl would actually benefit and not suffer any harm from the
treatment. She did not, and is doing well, he said.
</p><p>"The more her parents can be touching her and caring for her
... and involving her in family activities, the better for her," he
said. "The parents' argument was, `If she's smaller and lighter, we
will be able to do that for a longer period of time.'"
