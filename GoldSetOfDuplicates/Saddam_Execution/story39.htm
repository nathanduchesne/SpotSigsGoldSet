			<p>BAGHDAD,
Iraq (AP) -- Saddam Hussein has been transferred from U.S. custody, his
lawyers said, and an Iraqi judge authorized to attend the former
dictator's hanging said he would be executed no later than Saturday.<br><br>The
physical hand-over of Saddam to Iraqi authorities was believed to be
one of the last steps before he was to be hanged, although the lawyers'
statement did not specifically say Saddam was in Iraqi hands.<br><br>"A
few minutes ago we received correspondence from the Americans saying
that President Saddam Hussein is no longer under the control of U.S.
forces," according to the statement faxed to The Associated Press.<br><br>"Saddam
will be executed today or tomorrow," said Munir Haddad, a judge on the
appeals court that upheld Saddam's death sentence. "All the measures
have been done."<br><br>Haddad is authorized to attend the execution on behalf of the judiciary.</p>
