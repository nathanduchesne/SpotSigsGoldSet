Aid agency Oxfam urged the United Nations on Friday not to reduce its
peacekeeping force in Congo, warning on the eve of Secretary-General
Ban Ki-Moon&#8217;s visit that quitting could return the war-racked state to
chaos. Democratic Republic of Congo&#8217;s 17,000-strong UN mission, the
world&#8217;s largest, helped re-establish order following a 1998-2003 war
and kept the peace last year during the country&#8217;s first democratic
elections in more than four decades. The polls were applauded by
international observers and saw only isolated outbreaks of violence.
President Joseph Kabila was sworn in on Dec 6, vowing to tackle
violence in the mineral-rich, former Belgian colony at the heart of
Africa.<br><br><br><br><br><br>&#8216;Kathmandu a dump&#8217;<br><br>KATHMANDU:
Once seen as a Himalayan Shangri La, Nepal&#8217;s capital city and its
surrounding valley is now a smog-shrouded dump with rivers that smell
like a toilet, an environmental report has found. &#8220;Parks are being
destroyed, and the Bagmati river is sacred but now smells like a sewer
so nobody wants to take a holy dip,&#8221; Bidya Banmali Pradhan of the
International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) told
AFP. &#8220;You can see the problems very clearly,&#8221; said Pradhan, whose
organisation penned the damning report along with the United Nations
Environment Programme and Nepal&#8217;s environment ministry. The report,
released this week, concluded that the environmental damage could harm
impoverished Kathmandu&#8217;s economic future, particularly its key tourist
industry.<br><br><br><br>Poor country kids get vaccines<br><br>DAVOS:
Record numbers of children in poor countries are receiving life-saving
vaccines, thanks to a major investment programme backed by the private
sector and governments. Figures released on Friday at the World
Economic Forum estimated immunisation funded by the GAVI Alliance in
developing countries had avoided some 2.3 million early deaths since
2000. Despite the progress, however, more than 2 million children in
poor countries still die each year because they have not received
immunisations that are taken for granted in the industrialised world.
Melinda Gates, who with her husband and Microsoft founder Bill Gates
has committed $1.5 billion to GAVI, said the GAVI partnership was
spearheading a major turnaround in children&#8217;s health.<br><br></td>
