			urge</b></font><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#000080">Washington -</font> 
			Damage to a silver dollar-sized spot deep in the brain seems to wipe 
			out the urge to smoke, a surprising discovery that may shed 
			important new light on addiction. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The research was inspired by a 
			stroke survivor who claimed he simply forgot his two-pack-a-day 
			addiction _ no cravings, no nicotine patches, not even a conscious 
			desire to quit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"The quitting is like a light 
			switch that went off," said Dr. Antoine Bechara of the University of 
			Southern California, who scanned the brains of 69 smokers and 
			ex-smokers to pinpoint the region involved. "This is very striking."
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clearly brain damage isn't a 
			treatment option for people struggling to kick the habit. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the finding, reported in 
			Friday's edition of the journal Science, does point scientists 
			toward new ways to develop anti-smoking aids by targeting this 
			little-known brain region called the insula. And it sparked 
			excitement among addiction specialists who expect the insula to play 
			a key role in other addictions, too.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"It's a fantastic paper, it's a 
			fantastic finding," said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National 
			Institute on Drug Abuse and a longtime investigator of the brain's 
			addiction pathways. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"What this study shows 
			unequivocally is the insula is a key structure in the brain for 
			perceiving the urges to take the drug," urges that are "the backbone 
			of the addiction," Volkow added. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why? The insula appears to be where 
			the brain turns physical reactions into feelings, such as feeling 
			anxious when your heart speeds up. When those reactions are caused 
			by a particular substance, the insula may act like sort of a 
			headquarters for cravings. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some 44 million Americans smoke, 
			and the government says more than 400,000 a year die of 
			smoking-related illnesses. Declines in smoking have slowed in recent 
			years, making it unlikely that the nation will reach a public health 
			goal of reducing the rate to 12 percent by 2010. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nicotine is one of the most 
			addictive substances known, and it's common for smokers to suffer 
			repeated relapses when they try to quit. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So imagine Bechara's surprise at 
			hearing a patient he code-named "Nathan" note nonchalantly that "my 
			body forgot the urge to smoke" right after his stroke. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the time, Bechara was at the 
			University of Iowa studying the effects of certain types of brain 
			damage after strokes or other injury. While Nathan was hospitalized, 
			stroke specialists sent his information to that brain registry. He 
			was 38, had smoked since 14, said he enjoyed it and had had no 
			intention to quit. But his last puff was the night before his 
			stroke. His surprised wife said he never even asked for a smoke 
			while in the hospital. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not unusual for a health scare 
			to prompt an attempt at quitting. "That's the quitting that's not as 
			interesting," Bechara said. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead, Nathan experienced what 
			Bechara calls a "disruption of smoking addiction," and he wanted to 
			know why. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bechara</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"> 
			and colleagues culled their brain-damage registry for 69 patients 
			who had smoked regularly before their injuries. Nineteen, including 
			Nathan, had damage to the insula. Thirteen of the insula-damaged 
			patients had quit smoking, 12 of them super-easily: They quit within 
			a day of the brain injury, and reported neither smoking nor even 
			feeling the urge since then. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the remaining 50 patients with 
			damage in other brain regions, 19 quit smoking but only four met the 
			broken-addiction criteria. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Bechara's findings are 
			validated, they suggest that developing drugs that target the insula 
			might help smokers quit. There are nicotine receptors in the insula, 
			meaning it should be possible to create a nicotine-specific drug, 
			Bechara said _ albeit years from now. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More immediately, NIDA's Volkow 
			wants to try a different experiment: Scientists can temporarily 
			alter function of certain brain regions with pulses of magnetic 
			energy, called "transcranial magnetic stimulation." She wants to see 
			if it's possible to focus such magnetic pulses on the insula, and 
			thus verify its role. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other neurologic functions are 
			known to be involved with addiction, too, such as the brain's 
			"reward" or pleasure pathways. The insula discovery doesn't 
			contradict that work, but adds another layer to how addiction grips 
			the brain, Bechara said.-- <b><i>Associated Press</i></b></font></p>
