BAGHDAD, Iraq - Saddam Hussein will be executed no later than Saturday,
said an Iraqi judge authorized to attend his hanging. American and
Iraqi officials met to set the hour of his death. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Hussein&#8216;s
lawyers filed documents Friday afternoon asking for a stay of
execution. The 21-page request was filed in U.S. District Court in
Washington before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"To
protect those rights, defendant Saddam Hussein requests an order of
this court providing a stay of his execution until further notice of
this court," attorney Nicholas Gilman wrote. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Al-Bandar
argued that his trial violated his rights under the U.S. Constitution
but Justice countered that foreigners being tried in foreign courts are
not protected by the U.S. Constitution. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Saddam
received two of his half brothers in his cell on Thursday and was said
to have given them his personal belongings and a copy of his will. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Munir
Haddad, a judge on the appeals court that upheld Saddam&#8216;s death
sentence, said all documents required for the execution were ready.
They included an order known as a "red card" that must be delivered to
the head of the prison where Saddam is to be executed; a similar
document was also used in Iraqi courts during Saddam&#8216;s rule. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Those
cleared to attend the execution included a Muslim cleric, lawmakers,
senior officials and relatives of victims of Saddam&#8216;s brutal rule, the
official said. Aides to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki were waiting for
U.S. representatives to arrive at his office to set the hour for the
execution, the official said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Haddad said he was ready to attend the hanging. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">The
physical transfer of Saddam from U.S. to Iraqi authorities was believed
to be one of the last steps before he was to be hanged. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Al-Nauimi said U.S. authorities were maintaining physical custody of
Saddam to prevent him from being humiliated before his execution. He
said the Americans also want to prevent the mutilation of his corpse,
as has happened to other deposed Iraqi leaders. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
"The Americans want him to be hanged respectfully," al-Nauimi said. If
Saddam is humiliated publicly or his corpse ill-treated "that could
cause an uprising and the Americans would be blamed," he said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Saddam&#8216;s lawyers issued a statement Friday calling on "everybody to do
everything to stop this unfair execution." The statement also said the
former president had been transferred from U.S. custody, though
American and Iraqi officials later denied that. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Al-Maliki said opposing Saddam&#8216;s execution was an insult to his
victims. His office said he made the remarks in a meeting with families
of people who died during Saddam&#8216;s rule. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
"Our respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there
will be no review or delay in carrying out the sentence," al-Maliki
said. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Saddam has been in U.S. custody since he was captured in December 2003. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Tom Casey, deputy spokesman at the State Department, said Friday
afternoon that Saddam remained in American hands. In Baghdad, an Iraqi
government official who refused to be identified by name because he was
not authorized to release the information said authorities there were
not yet in control of Saddam. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
On Thursday, two half brothers visited Saddam in his cell, a member of
the former dictator&#8216;s defense team, Badee Izzat Aref, told The
Associated Press by telephone from the United Arab Emirates. He said
the former dictator handed them his personal belongings. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
A senior official at the Iraqi defense ministry also confirmed the
meeting and said Saddam gave his will to one of his half brothers. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized
to speak to the media. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Saddam&#8216;s lawyers later issued a statement saying the Americans gave permission for his belongings to be retrieved. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Raed Juhi, spokesman for the High Tribunal court that convicted Saddam,
said documents related to the execution, including the "red card,"
al-Maliki&#8216;s signed approval of the sentence and the appeal court&#8216;s
decision would be read to Saddam before the execution. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
An Iraqi appeals court upheld Saddam&#8216;s death sentence Tuesday for the
killing of 148 people who were detained after an attempt to assassinate
him in the northern Iraqi city of Dujail in 1982. The court said the
former president should be hanged within 30 days. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
There had been disagreements among Iraqi officials in recent days as to
whether Iraqi law dictates the execution must take place within 30 days
and whether President Jalal Talabani and his two deputies have to
approve it. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> In his Friday sermon, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf called Saddam&#8216;s execution "God&#8216;s gift to Iraqis." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
"Oh, God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis
in prisons, in wars with neighboring countries and he is responsible
for mass graves," said Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , known as SCIRI, a
dominant party in al-Maliki&#8216;s coalition. "Oh God, we ask you to take
revenge on Saddam." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> Associated Press writer Matt Apuzzo contributed to this story from Washington.   	 		 <br><br>
