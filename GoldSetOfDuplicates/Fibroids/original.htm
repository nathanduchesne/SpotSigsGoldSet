<div id="storybody">
<p>WEDNESDAY, Jan. 24 (HealthDay News) - Women with uterine fibroids
who are treated with embolization, a minimally invasive procedure, may
get out of bed and back to work faster. But after a year, their
quality-of-life scores are about the same as for women who had surgery
to treat the non-cancerous growths, a new study found.</p>
<p>In the Jan. 25 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,
Scottish researchers report that hospital stays for embolization
average just a day, compared to about five days for surgical
treatments. </p>
<p>"The choice is essentially up to the patient. Hysterectomy has a
very high success rate, but longer recovery. Embolization has a
slightly lower success rate, but faster recover, and you keep your
uterus," said the study's lead author, Dr. Jonathan Moss, a consultant
interventional radiologist at Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow. </p>
<p>A fibroid is a non-cancerous growth that develops in the uterus. As
many as 20 percent of women of child-bearing age have one or more
fibroids, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. The
incidence of fibroids increases with age. Most fibroids don't require
treatment, but some cause excessive bleeding and may cause pain. </p>
<p>When fibroids cause symptoms, treatment options may include hormone
therapy, surgery or uterine-artery embolization. Surgical options
include hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the entire uterus, or
myomectomy, which is the removal of each individual fibroid.
Embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that reduces the blood
supply to the fibroids, causing them to shrink. For women who may still
want to have children, myomectomy is currently the recommended
treatment. </p>
<p>Because embolization is a relatively new technique - it was
introduced in 1995 - the researchers wanted to assess how it compares
to surgical options. </p><div id="advert300x250">

<p>For the study, 157 women were randomly assigned to undergo
embolization or surgery. One hundred and six women had embolization, 43
had hysterectomies and eight had myomectomies. </p>
<p>The average hospital stay was one day for embolization, compared to
five days for surgery. Those who underwent embolization also got back
to their daily activities faster than women in the surgical group.
Women in the embolization group were able to drive a car after an
average of eight days, compared to 34 days for the surgical group. The
embolization group was back at work, on average, 20 days after the
procedure, versus 62 days for the surgery group. And women in the
embolization group were able to resume sexual activity within an
average of 21 days, compared to 53 days for those who had surgery, the
researchers said.</p>
<p>The complication rates were similar overall, with 15 percent of
those in the embolization group and 20 percent of those in the surgery
group reporting serious adverse events. </p>
<p>Yet, after one year, there were no statistically significant differences in quality-of-life scores. </p>
<p>"The biggest problem of surgery, whether myomectomy or hysterectomy,
is the time to recover from the operation. This was much faster
following embolization," Moss said. "The other problem with
hysterectomy is not every woman is happy with that option. The biggest
problem with embolization is that it doesn't always work. Ten to 20
percent of patients will ultimately need it repeated or to have a
hysterectomy." </p>
<p>Dr. William Romano, an interventional radiologist at William
Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., said he would have liked to have
seen more women in the myomectomy group, because women today are often
choosing between embolization and myomectomy. He said he was surprised
by the larger numbers of hysterectomies in this study. </p>
<p>For women who know they don't want to have any more children, Romano
said, "Patients should consider embolization as a first-line procedure,
because, in many situations, it may be all they need." </p>
<p>For women who still want to have children, embolization is rarely
considered because its safety for pregnancy hasn't been well-studied,
he said. "The data doesn't support embolization as a viable primary
option for women interested in childbearing," Romano said.</p>
<p>Still, he added, it could be an option for women who are afraid to
have surgery or for women with many fibroids, because myomectomy can be
a more difficult procedure for multiple fibroids. </p>
