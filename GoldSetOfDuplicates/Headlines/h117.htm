   <br><br></font><p><font face="arial" size="2">					 	 		</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> By JILL LAWLESS, Associated Press Writer   46 minutes ago  		 	  </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
LONDON - She makes headlines for getting a parking ticket, newspapers
comment on her fashion choices, and her 25th birthday on Tuesday is
generating a media storm. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Prince
William&#8216;s girlfriend, Kate Middleton, may one day become queen of
England. Before then, she is undergoing the ordeal seemingly demanded
of royal wannabes since Lady Diana Spencer began dating Prince Charles
more than a quarter-century ago. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Pictures
of the brunette fashion buyer, who has dated William since both were
university students, fetch thousands of dollars from the tabloid press.
Paparazzi follow her to work, on shopping trips and on nights out with
the prince. One recent, widely published snapshot showed Middleton
receiving a ticket from a parking warden outside her London home. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">"It
would be more of a surprise now if they split than if they marry," said
Robert Jobson, author of the recently published book "William&#8216;s
Princess." </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">British
bookmaking firm William Hill says it is so certain William will pop the
question, it has stopped taking bets on whether the pair will get
engaged &#8212; only on the date. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">William
Hill said it is a 4-5 probability the pair will announce their
engagement in 2007, and is offering 3-1 odds they will marry this year.
</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that the two may soon announce their engagement. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">As
a high school student she attended an elite private school, where she
played tennis and field hockey, before studying art history at St.
Andrews. She and William shared a student house in the seaside
university town. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Preliminary
hearings for an inquest into Diana&#8216;s death in a 1997 car crash opened
at London&#8216;s Royal Courts of Justice on Monday. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">Middleton&#8216;s
lawyers have complained to newspaper editors, requesting she be left
alone, and British newspapers have recently reported that she is to be
given a round-the-clock guard from the police royal protection squad &#8212;
a key sign of inclusion in the royal circle. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"> The royal family appears to be quietly easing Middleton into its public events, as well. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
Last month, she was in attendance, along with the queen, when William,
24, graduated from Sandhurst military academy. He has since joined the
Blues and Royals, an elite cavalry regiment. </font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">
"The queen was there, yet Kate stole the limelight," Jobson said. "The
fact they allowed her to do that signaled intent. It shows that this is
a very serious relationship. It&#8216;s not a frivolous one." <br><br>
