		<p class="ByLine">Last Updated:<br>01-04-07 at 3:25PM</p>
		<span class="FullStory"><p><b>CHICAGO --</b>
In a case fraught with ethical questions, the parents of a severely
mentally and physically disabled child have stunted her growth to keep
their little "pillow angel" a manageable and more portable size.<br><br>The
bedridden 9-year-old girl had her uterus and breast tissue removed at a
Seattle hospital and received large doses of hormones to halt her
growth. She is now 4-foot-5; her parents say she would otherwise
probably reach a normal 5-foot-6.<br><br>The case has captured
attention nationwide and abroad via the Internet, with some decrying
the parents' actions as perverse and akin to eugenics. Some ethicists
question the parents' claim that the drastic treatment will benefit
their daughter and allow them to continue caring for her at home.<br><br>University
of Pennsylvania ethicist Art Caplan said the case is troubling and
reflects "slippery slope" thinking among parents who believe "the way
to deal with my kid with permanent behavioral problems is to put them
into permanent childhood."<br><br>Right or wrong, the couple's decision
highlights a dilemma thousands of parents face in struggling to care
for severely disabled children as they grow up.<br><br>"This particular
treatment, even if it's OK in this situation, and I think it probably
is, is not a widespread solution and ignores the large social issues
about caring for people with disabilities," Dr. Joel Frader, a medical
ethicist at Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital, said Thursday. "As
a society, we do a pretty rotten job of helping caregivers provide
what's necessary for these patients."<br><br>The case involves a girl
identified only as Ashley on a blog her parents created after her
doctors wrote about her treatment in October's Archives of Pediatrics
&amp; Adolescent Medicine. The journal did not disclose the parents'
names or where they live; the couple do not identify themselves on
their blog, either.<br><br>Shortly after birth, Ashley had feeding
problems and showed severe developmental delays. Her doctors diagnosed
static encephalopathy, which means severe brain damage. They do not
know what caused it.<br><br>Her condition has left her in an infant
state, unable to sit up, roll over, hold a toy or walk or talk. Her
parents say she will never get better. She is alert, startles easily,
and smiles, but does not maintain eye contact, according to her
parents, who call the brown-haired little girl their "pillow angel."<br><br>She
goes to school for disabled children, but her parents care for her at
home and say they have been unable to find suitable outside help.<br><br>An
editorial in the medical journal called "the Ashley treatment"
ill-advised and questioned whether it will even work. But her parents
say it has succeeded so far.<br><br>She had surgery in July 2004 and
recently completed the hormone treatment. She weighs about 65 pounds,
and is about 13 inches shorter and 50 pounds lighter than she would be
as an adult, according to her parents' blog.<br><br>"Ashley's smaller
and lighter size makes it more possible to include her in the typical
family life and activities that provide her with needed comfort,
closeness, security and love: meal time, car trips, touch, snuggles,
etc.," her parents wrote.<br><br>Also, Ashley's parents say keeping her
small will reduce the risk of bedsores and other conditions that can
afflict bedridden patients. In addition, they say preventing her from
going through puberty means she won't experience the discomfort of
periods or grow breasts that might develop breast cancer, which runs in
the family.<br><br>"Even though caring for Ashley involves hard and
continual work, she is a blessing and not a burden," her parents say.
Still, they write, "Unless you are living the experience ... you have
no clue what it is like to be the bedridden child or their caregivers."<br><br>Caplan
questioned how preventing normal growth could benefit the patient.
Treatment that is not for a patient's direct benefit "only seems wrong
to me," the ethicist said.<br><br>Dr. Douglas Diekema, an ethicist at
Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, where
Ashley was treated, said he met with the parents and became convinced
they were motivated by love and the girl's best interests.<br><br>Diekema
said he was mainly concerned with making sure the little girl would
actually benefit and not suffer any harm from the treatment. She did
not, and is doing well, he said.<br><br>"The more her parents can be
touching her and caring for her ... and involving her in family
activities, the better for her," he said. "The parents' argument was,
`If she's smaller and lighter, we will be able to do that for a longer
period of time.'"<br><br></p></span></td>
