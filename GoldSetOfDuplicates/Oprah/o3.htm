			<h1>Oprah brings book club back to life with Poitier's 'The Measure of a Man'</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="storyDate"> 26, 2007 - 0:20 pm</span>

			<br><span class="byLine"><br>By: HILLEL ITALIE</span>
                
			</p>




<span id="articleCopy">

			<p>NEW YORK (AP) - If her goal was to
erase the memory of the disgraced James Frey, then Oprah Winfrey
couldn't have made a better pick for her book club than a memoir by
Sidney Poitier.</p>
			
			<p>Winfrey ended a year-long hiatus in her
club by announcing Friday that she had chosen "The Measure of a Man," a
"spiritual autobiography" by one of Hollywood's most admired actors -
for whom the word "dignified" could practically be copyrighted - and a
personal hero of Winfrey's.</p>
			
			<p>Published in 2000,
Poitier's book combines memories of such plays and films as "A Raisin
in the Sun" and "The Defiant Ones" with observations about the Academy
Award-winning actor's childhood, his religious faith, his thoughts on
racism and the influence of such world leaders as Nelson Mandela and
Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
			
			<p>"He writes really candidly and
passionately about his childhood, his family, relationships and his
extraordinary career," Winfrey said on her show, which airs from
Chicago. "It (the book) really is about what makes character, what
makes you be who you are. He is the measure of one of the greatest men
I think who has ever been on our planet."</p>
			
			<p>Poitier did
not appear on the telecast. But Winfrey said she will host "a once in a
lifetime dinner party" with Poitier that will include members of her
book club.</p>
			
			<p>"The Measure of a Man" spent several weeks
on The New York Times' list of best sellers, and the audio edition,
narrated by Poitier, won a Grammy Award for best spoken word album.
Poitier wrote a previous memoir, "This Life," released in 1980.</p>
			
			<p>Right
before Winfrey announced her selection, the 56th for her book club,
"The Measure of a Man" ranked 288,958 on Amazon.com, a number that
quickly changed, soaring to the top 50 within three hours. Winfrey's
picks almost inevitably top best seller lists.</p>
			
			<p>Mark
Tauber, vice president and deputy publisher of HarperSanFrancisco, an
imprint of HarperCollins, declined Friday to say how many books would
be printed, but did say he expects to sell hundreds of thousands of
copies.</p>
			
			<p>Tauber also said that, unlike many celebrity
memoirists, Poitier did not use a ghostwriter, although the actor did
have editorial "help."</p>
			
			<p>"I'm sure there'll be
speculation about Winfrey picking yet another memoir," Tauber said.
"But Poitier's life is filled with so much integrity."</p>
			
			<p>Winfrey
and Poitier have met in the past. During an interview in her own "O"
magazine in 2000 - around the time "Measure of a Man" was released -
Winfrey and Poitier discussed his life and career; the talk show host
confided that she felt like a star-struck fan.</p>
			
			<p>"Poitier
and I are sitting across from each other at the Bel-Air hotel in Los
Angeles - and I'm admiring that, at 73, this man still personifies
grace, ease, strength and courage," Winfrey wrote at the time. "He is a
gentleman in every sense of the word. In my more than 25 years as an
interviewer, I've talked to hundreds of people - yet today, I'm giddy."</p>
			
			<p>Poitier,
who turns 80 on Feb. 20, became the first black performer to win the
Oscar for best actor, cited in 1964 for "Lilies of the Field." His
other films include "In the Heat of the Night," "To Sir, With Love" and
"The Blackboard Jungle." In 2002, he received an honorary Oscar for
lifetime achievement.</p>
			
			<p>He should be a welcome break from
the travesty of Frey, whose "A Million Little Pieces" was picked by
Winfrey in the fall of 2005, only to have The Smoking Gun website
reveal in January 2006 that the memoir was largely fabricated. Winfrey
initially defended Frey, then changed her mind, brought him back to the
show and chewed him out.</p>
			
			<p>Winfrey's next pick, Elie
Wiesel's "Night," was announced on Jan. 16, 2006, soon after the Frey
scandal broke, but had already been decided upon weeks earlier. More
than 1.5 million copies of Wiesel's Holocaust memoir were sold because
of Winfrey's selection, according to publisher Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux.</p>
			
			<p>Winfrey acknowledged on Friday's show that it
had been a year since she had chosen a selection for her book club. But
she didn't blame Frey. Instead, she said she was busy during that time
researching curriculum for her school for disadvantaged girls in South
Africa, which opened earlier this month.</p>
			
			<p>"So I really did not have time to devote to reading other books," she said. "But now I do."</p>
			
			<p>-Tara Burghart in Chicago contributed to this report.</p>
