<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> SAN
FRANCISCO - Wildlife officials on Thursday credited a woman with saving
her husband's life by clubbing a mountain lion that attacked him while
the couple were hiking in a California state park.
</font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jim
and Nell Hamm, who will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary next
month, were hiking in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park when the lion
pounced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"He
didn't scream. It was a different, horrible plea for help, and I turned
around, and by then the cat had wrestled Jim to the ground," Nell Hamm
said in an interview from the hospital where her husband was recovering
from a torn scalp, puncture wounds and other injuries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After
the attack, game wardens closed the park about 320 miles north of San
Francisco and released hounds to track the lion. They later shot and
killed a pair of lions found near the trail where the attack happened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The carcasses were flown to a state forensics lab to determine if either animal mauled the man.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Although
the Hamms are experienced hikers, neither had seen a mountain lion
before Jim Hamm was mauled, his wife said. Nell Hamm said she grabbed a
four-inch-wide log and beat the animal with it, but it would not
release its hold on her husband's head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Jim
was talking to me all through this, and he said, 'I've got a pen in my
pocket and get the pen and jab him in the eye,'" she said. "So I got
the pen and tried to put it in his eye, but it didn't want to go in as
easy as I thought it would."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When
the pen bent and became useless, Nell Hamm went back to using the log.
The lion eventually let go and, with blood on its snout, stood staring
at the woman. She screamed and waved the log until the animal walked
away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"She saved his life, there is no doubt about it," said Steve Martarano, a spokesman for the Department of Fish and Game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Nell
Hamm, 65, said she was scared to leave her dazed, bleeding husband
alone, so the couple walked a quarter-mile to a trail head, where she
gathered branches to protect them if more lions came around. They
waited until a ranger came by and summoned help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"My concern was to get Jim out of there," she said. "I told him, 'Get up, get up, walk,' and he did."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jim
Hamm, 70, was in fair condition Thursday. He had to have his lips
stitched back together and underwent surgery for lacerations on his
head and body. He told his wife he still wants to make the trip to New
Zealand they planned for their anniversary, she said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Nell
Hamm warned people never to hike in the backcountry alone. Park rangers
told the couple if Jim Hamm had been alone, he probably would not have
survived.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We fought harder than we ever have to save his life, and we fought together," she said.</font></p>
