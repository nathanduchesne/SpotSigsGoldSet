WASHINGTON - Seconds before the crash of a commuter jet that took off
from the wrong runway, the co-pilot noted it was "weird" that the
Lexington, Ky., airstrip had no lights, according to the transcript of
a cockpit recording released Wednesday.
</font><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
captain responded, "Yeah." The last intelligible word on the recording
is the captain saying, "Whoa" just a second before impact.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Forty-nine
of the 50 people aboard Comair Flight 5191 died on Aug. 27 after the
plane took off in the dark from a runway too short for a passenger jet.
The plane struggled to get into the air and went down in flames.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Co-pilot
James Polehinke was the lone survivor, losing a leg and suffering brain
damage. He has told relatives he remembers nothing about that morning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">According
to federal investigators, Capt. Jeffrey Clay taxied the plane onto the
wrong runway at Lexington's Blue Grass Airport before Polehinke took
over the controls for takeoff.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Polehinke said: "I'll take us to Atlanta." Clay responded, "Sure."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Polehinke said it was "weird with no lights," according to the 









National Transportation Safety Board transcript. Clay responded, "Yeah." And then, "Whoa."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was
the first time the public was given access to the transcripts of what
the Comair pilots told each other in the cockpit during the ill-fated
flight, which was the deadliest American aviation disaster in five
years.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sixteen
of the passengers suffered smoke inhalation, indicating they survived
the initial impact, the NTSB said. Other passengers sustained internal
and brain injuries, broken bones, severed limbs and burns.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In a
statement, Comair said: "We recognize the investigation is a long and
difficult process for the families, especially when announcements &#8212;
such as today's &#8212; receive intense public scrutiny. Our desire is to
learn as much as we can in order to prevent these kinds of accidents
from happening again."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Numerous lawsuits have been filed accusing Comair of negligence. However, the airline has sued the airport and the 









Federal Aviation Administration, contending they are partially responsible.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A week
before the crash, the taxiways at Blue Grass were altered as part of a
construction project, but the maps and charts used in the cockpits of
Comair and other airlines were not updated. The FAA did notify airlines
of the changes through a separate announcement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
transcripts and other documents were also the first time federal
officials identified Christopher Damron as the lone air traffic
controller on duty in the tower at the time of the crash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The jet
was supposed to take off from the 7,000-foot main runway, called runway
22, but instead used 3,500-foot runway 26, which is meant only for
smaller planes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The
NTSB has said Damron cleared the jet for takeoff, then turned away to
do administrative work and did not see the plane turn down the wrong
runway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">According
to documents released Wednesday, Damron initially told investigators he
watched the plane move onto runway 22. Later he changed his account to
explain he just saw it on the taxiway leading to runway 22.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After finishing his administrative work, Damron "heard a crash and saw a fireball west of the airport," the NTSB said.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Damron
was initially placed on leave after the crash but returned to work late
last year. A call to his Lexington home went unanswered Wednesday.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As they
prepared for takeoff, Polehinke asked, "What runway?" and inquired
about runway 24 &#8212; which does not exist. Clay immediately responded,
"It's 22."
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An
engineering report also released Wednesday concluded the pilots never
tried to abort the takeoff or realized they were on the wrong runway.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Leading up to takeoff, the pilot and co-pilot discussed their families, co-workers and job opportunities.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Louise
Roselle, one of the attorneys representing victims' families, said the
pilots' conversation about searching for other jobs reinforces one of
the central issues in the lawsuits related to the crash.
</font></p><p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It reinforces how Comair has been treating its pilots," Roselle said.
