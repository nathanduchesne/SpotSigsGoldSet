                <p class="storybody">Hussein's
lawyers filed documents Friday afternoon asking for a stay of
execution. The 21-page request was filed in U.S. District Court in
Washington before Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.<br><br>Attorneys argued
that because Hussein also faces a civil lawsuit in Washington, he has
rights as a civil defendant that would be violated if he is executed.
He has not received notice of those rights and the consequences that
the lawsuit would have on his estate, his attorneys said.<br><br>"To
protect those rights, defendant Saddam Hussein requests an order of
this court providing a stay of his execution until further notice of
this court," attorney Nicholas Gilman wrote.<br><br>A similar request
by the former chief justice of the Revolutionary Court, Awad Hamed
al-Bandar, was denied Thursday and is under appeal. Al-Bandar also
faces execution. The Justice Department argued in that case that U.S.
courts have no jurisdiction to interfere with the judicial process of
another country.<br><br>Al-Bandar argued that his trial violated his
rights under the U.S. Constitution but Justice countered that
foreigners being tried in foreign courts are not protected by the U.S.
Constitution.<br><br>The appeals court did not indicate when it would rule on the issue.<br><br>Saddam
received two of his half brothers in his cell on Thursday and was said
to have given them his personal belongings and a copy of his will.<br><br>Najeeb
al-Nauimi, a member of Saddam's legal team, said he too requested a
final meeting with the deposed Iraqi leader. "His daughter in Amman was
crying, she said 'Take me with you,'" al-Nauimi said late Friday. But
he said their request was rejected.<br><br>Munir Haddad, a judge on the
appeals court that upheld Saddam's death sentence, said all documents
required for the execution were ready. They included an order known as
a "red card" that must be delivered to the head of the prison where
Saddam is to be executed; a similar document was also used in Iraqi
courts during Saddam's rule.<br><br>With U.S. forces on high alert for
a surge in violence, people registered to attend the hanging gathered
Friday in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone before they were to go
to the execution site, a senior Iraqi government official said on
condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the
media.<br><br>Those cleared to attend the execution included a Muslim
cleric, lawmakers, senior officials and relatives of victims of
Saddam's brutal rule, the official said. Aides to Prime Minister Nouri
al-Maliki were waiting for U.S. representatives to arrive at his office
to set the hour for the execution, the official said.<br><br>He did not disclose the location of the gallows.<br><br>Haddad said he was ready to attend the hanging.<br><br>"Saddam will be executed today or tomorrow," Haddad said. "All the measures have been done. ... There is no reason for delays."<br><br>The
physical transfer of Saddam from U.S. to Iraqi authorities was believed
to be one of the last steps before he was to be hanged.<br><br>"We have
agreed with the Americans that the handover will take place only a few
minutes before he is executed," the official said.<br><br>Al-Nauimi
said U.S. authorities were maintaining physical custody of Saddam to
prevent him from being humiliated before his execution. He said the
Americans also want to prevent the mutilation of his corpse, as has
happened to other deposed Iraqi leaders.<br><br>"The Americans want him
to be hanged respectfully," al-Nauimi said. If Saddam is humiliated
publicly or his corpse ill-treated "that could cause an uprising and
the Americans would be blamed," he said.<br><br>Saddam's lawyers issued
a statement Friday calling on "everybody to do everything to stop this
unfair execution." The statement also said the former president had
been transferred from U.S. custody, though American and Iraqi officials
later denied that.<br><br>Al-Maliki said opposing Saddam's execution
was an insult to his victims. His office said he made the remarks in a
meeting with families of people who died during Saddam's rule.<br><br>"Our
respect for human rights requires us to execute him, and there will be
no review or delay in carrying out the sentence," al-Maliki said.<br><br>Saddam has been in U.S. custody since he was captured in December 2003.<br><br>Tom
Casey, deputy spokesman at the State Department, said Friday afternoon
that Saddam remained in American hands. In Baghdad, an Iraqi government
official who refused to be identified by name because he was not
authorized to release the information said authorities there were not
yet in control of Saddam.<br><br>On Thursday, two half brothers visited
Saddam in his cell, a member of the former dictator's defense team,
Badee Izzat Aref, told The Associated Press by telephone from the
United Arab Emirates. He said the former dictator handed them his
personal belongings.<br><br>A senior official at the Iraqi defense
ministry also confirmed the meeting and said Saddam gave his will to
one of his half brothers. The official spoke on condition of anonymity
because he was not authorized to speak to the media.<br><br>Saddam's lawyers later issued a statement saying the Americans gave permission for his belongings to be retrieved.<br><br>Raed
Juhi, spokesman for the High Tribunal court that convicted Saddam, said
documents related to the execution, including the "red card,"
al-Maliki's signed approval of the sentence and the appeal court's
decision would be read to Saddam before the execution.<br><br>An Iraqi
appeals court upheld Saddam's death sentence Tuesday for the killing of
148 people who were detained after an attempt to assassinate him in the
northern Iraqi city of Dujail in 1982. The court said the former
president should be hanged within 30 days.<br><br>There had been
disagreements among Iraqi officials in recent days as to whether Iraqi
law dictates the execution must take place within 30 days and whether
President Jalal Talabani and his two deputies have to approve it.<br><br>In his Friday sermon, a mosque preacher in the Shiite holy city of Najaf called Saddam's execution "God's gift to Iraqis."<br><br>"Oh,
God, you know what Saddam has done! He killed millions of Iraqis in
prisons, in wars with neighboring countries and he is responsible for
mass graves," said Sheik Sadralddin al-Qubanji, a member of the Supreme
Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, known as SCIRI, a dominant
party in al-Maliki's coalition. "Oh God, we ask you to take revenge on
Saddam."<br><br>Associated Press writer Matt Apuzzo contributed to this story from Washington.<br><br>A service of the Associated Press(AP)</p>
