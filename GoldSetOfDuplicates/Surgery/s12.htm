- In a case fraught with ethical questions, the parents of a severely
mentally and physically disabled child have stunted her growth to keep
their little "pillow angel" a manageable and more portable size.
if(window.yzq_d==null)window.yzq_d=new Object();
window.yzq_d['h38TANG_fyk-']='&amp;U=13adsin3h%2fN%3dh38TANG_fyk-%2fC%3d488264.9743073.10453101.2811172%2fD%3dLREC%2fB%3d4184355';
</p><p>The bedridden 9-year-old girl had her uterus and breast tissue
removed at a Seattle hospital and received large doses of hormones to
halt her growth. She is now 4-foot-5; her parents say she would
otherwise probably reach a normal 5-foot-6."</p><p>&nbsp;Here is the blog of the parents of Ashley, and their reasons for the surgery:</p><p><a href="http://ashleytreatment.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ashleytreatment.spaces.live.com/</a></p><p>Now here I go with my opinion regarding this story...</p><p>How
much does it really help Ashley to remain small?&nbsp; This seems to
just aid in difficulties because the parents have made it so that
Ashley never will look normal.&nbsp; As an adult, she will still appear
to be a child.&nbsp; Is this really for the better?</p><p>&nbsp;God
created human beings in His image and likeness.&nbsp; We are supposed
to respect His creations and not alter them.&nbsp; These parents are
acting like God.&nbsp; I do not believe that they have the right to
stop Ashley's growth, remove her breast buds and, sterilize her.</p><p>How
can this really be a 2006 medical procedure?&nbsp; It's sterilization,
for goodness sake!!!&nbsp; The doctors say that he condition is so bad
that she'll never have a hope for reproduction, so it isn't considered
sterilization.&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;she now has absolutely 0% of
reproduction.&nbsp; This seems like sterilization to me.&nbsp; And I
didn't think sterilization was permitted in the 21st century.</p><p>The
parents seem to have no hope for their child.&nbsp; They think that
she's stuck in the place she's currently at forever.&nbsp; But miracles
happen.&nbsp; Who knows what Ashley's future may hold.&nbsp; But now it
definitely does not hold the potential of growth, puberty, or
reproduction.&nbsp; I think that Ashley's parents are hindering her
more than helping her.&nbsp; She is now doomed to never have even a
partially normal life because she will be stuck in the place of a
9-year old forever.&nbsp; This does not seem to be a good decision to
me.</p>

    <div class="content"><p><i>She has been at the same level of cognitive and mental developmental ability since about three months of age.</i></p>
<p>Not to sound like a heartless person, or deny the chance of fate
intervening but, when an individual like Ashley is presented with an
anomaly like that, and the brain development is stunted by reasons that
not only confound doctors or any potential chance of growth, the age
old saying exists - it is the parent's decision what they feel is best.</p>
<p>Also if you note in the support of others who have visited the site
towards the end--as well as the parent's own personal remarks--the
grace of God is on their side. They're not <i>playing</i> God, nor are they acknowledging such an idea. </p>
<p>I genuinely feel horrible when someone's life is plagued by an
ailment or debilitating malady such as this but again, the parents, and
research, personal records of other caregivers (Which also my boyfriend
is in an Alzheimer's Care Residence. I am rather familiar with the
trials and tribulations of tending to people.) it alleviates the
discomfort a person may be faced with, and those who care for the
individual have an 'easier' time to care for the person. They are there
to help, they chose to be the Good Samaritan and tend to those in need
on a daily basis who cannot do it for themselves. That alone, I think
God would smile upon showing faith and love amongst mankind, rather
than splitting hairs, or doing the injustice of possible accusatory
remarks that the parents are trying to play the role of the lord.</p>

<h3 class="title"><a href="http://www.progressiveu.org/184953-the-ashley-treatment#comment-131945" class="active">If you would have bothered</a></h3>
    <div class="content"><p>If
you would have bothered to read the parent's blog, you might understand
why they did it. I'm a religious person, but what God made in his image
VS what is really going on should be taken into more consideration. If
there is a 100% chance she wont ever have kids, then there is no harm
done, they brought up good points, they don't want their child in pain.
Would you do the same to your child? Would you say "hey, we know she
wont have children, we are certain about that, it'd be in the best
interest for her to take it out, she wont have her period, she wont be
in pain" Or would you sit back and say "yeh go ahead, let her bleed,
let her be in pain, we don't care, she can't tell us, so if we don't
know, we don't care" Cause that's awefully cruel. Sorry to say, but her
being sterile isn't such a concern when they are trying to help their
child live as painlessly as possible.</p>
<p>And I don't know if you are aware or not, but no matter what your
body looks like, your mind determines how old you are. If some wonder
did happen, and say she was in her 20's and began to talk and walk and
such, that's her mind, in her mind she will be older, she will have
come a long way. I'm sorry, but you do what's best for your child, you
think about NOW, you don't let a child suffer just so you can hope
something will come years down the road. You have to stay hopeful, but
you also can not let someone suffer, that's the cruelest thing you
could do. If she over comes this, they didn't do perminant damage to
her, she'd be able to walk, talk, think, act, everything, she'd just be
lacking breasts and the ability to have children. It's not like they
cut off her limbs. </p>
<p>You have to think rationally, her parents did, they talked to
doctors. People are smart enough, specially when it comes to children,
to say "No, we wont do this" "We can't do this" or "This might be a
good idea, which will help your child"</p>

<h3 class="title"><a href="http://www.progressiveu.org/184953-the-ashley-treatment#comment-131961" class="active">This is a tough one.
First,</a></h3>
    <div class="content"><p>This is a tough one.</p>
<p>First, leaving God out of it, the parents seem to only be doing what
they genuinely feel is the right thing to do. After reading the article
and their blog site, I don't get the feeling at all that they went
through this procedure simply for convenience to them. The concerns
they raised and subsequently addressed were valid concerns. In a way, I
think that Ashley is somewhat lucky that she had parents that tried to
combat these potential problems and discomforts before they became real
problems.</p>
<p>And secondly (now bringing God back into it) we really don't know
how they came up with these decisions. They claim it was an easy
decision to make, but I wonder how accurate that really is? Perhaps
they spent weeks praying, or talking with several specialists, friends,
family, or even support groups? We really don't know. My guess is that
these procedures were suggested to them when they were looking for
answers to these types of problems. And more than likely these
decisions came from a realization that the doctors simply cannot do
anything more for Ashley; something that they probably had a hard time
accepting to begin with.</p>
<p>But, I can see why others might view this as an attempt to play God.
The problem is, they might have gotten this message from God (relying
on that logic). I mean, okay... You talk to God all the time, yes? And
he tells you how to live and has shown you what to do, in your eyes...
right? Even though there are people that disagree with how you portray
yourself at times (both Christians and Non Christians) you feel that
you are doing your best to live a life that God would appreciate.
Right? Perhaps they are only doing the same thing?</p>
